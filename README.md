# Content-Based-Image-Retreival

OS - Linux (Debian - Ubuntu 22.04)
IDE - None (CLE using terminal)


Build instructions: 
1. Use CMakeLists.txt to generate make file ten build target and then execute target (Command line execution using terminal in Linux (debian))
2. Will need to install wxWidgets to get the Project up and running. The link to the installation video I used is - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TDnnlyscM No need for codeblocks IDE since I have used Cmake file to generate the executable.
3. If any of the tasks do not mirror, please build and execute once again. 
4. Please wait for one task to finish before attempting the next task.
5. If terminal is used to exceute the project, one can also see the image name and the distance as I have output them on console.
6. Make sure the target image is also in the same folder
